1.9.0
[*] Completely restructured the save EPUB routine as it applied to creators. This was a major restructuring of the code, so please be careful using it. Only use this version with EPUBs that have been backed up, just in case the save procedure goes bad!
[*] Fixed "Remove <meta /> tags" button (in the OPF editor window), which was crashing on some OPF files.
[*] Fixed errors in the Batch "Replace" function.
